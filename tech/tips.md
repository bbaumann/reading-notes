1. **Be humble** - No engineer in the world knows everything, the same applies to you.
1. **Make it work, make it right** (and sometimes make it fast).
1. **Optimize for change** - Prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction.
1. **Always write tests** - If you're not writing tests, you're testing manually.
1. **Solve 80% of use cases** - You never gonna solve everyone’s problem.
1. **Prefer functional programming** - It's easier to understand. If your code requires a Ph.D. to understand, you’re most likely doing it wrong.
1. **Delete as much code as you can**
1. **Good Enough is Better than Perfect** - Don't discard meaningful improvement just because it's not perfect.
1. **Criticize in private, praise in public**
1. **Make notes** - If you think you will remember it, you're lying to yourself.
1. **Talk to your users** - The best software is built by engineers who have empathy for their users.
1. **Learn with intention** - Practice with a clear and specific goal in mind** - what you want to improve and exactly how (deliberate practice).
1. **Do not generalize early** - Wait until you have at least 3 duplicates of code before you make an abstraction (aka. Rule Of Three).
1. **Fix broken windows** - One hack in code leads to another hack. Soon your code will become unmanageable.
1. **Fix the problem** - doesn't matter whose fault it is, it is your problem.
1. **Do what works, not what's fashionable** - Try it first with a small team. If it works, expand. If not, abort.
1. **The best work requires a good rest** - Regular time off is essential for top performance. You also don’t expect professional sprinters to sprint all the time.
1. **Take small steps** - Big rewrites don't work. You will lose motivation and focus along the way. Aim to release daily. It gives you the freedom to change focus when necessary.
1. **Praise for good work** - Something we've observed in animals, but works for people too. You will get better results when you praise people for good work rather than punishing them for a bad one.
1. **Perfect code doesn't exist** - It's better to accept this as a fact rather than wasting time and chasing the impossible.
