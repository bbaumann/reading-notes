* Remote or Hybrid teams need connection and it's hard to build a sense of community.
* Things can be tried, improved or abandonned.
* Offer opportunity to people to opt out if they feel uncomfortable with the activity.

1. **Start meetings with Red/Yellow/Green check-ins**
Helps people share mood & feeling.  
Works great in small teams.  
Green represents happy and open; yellow indicates a little stressed; and red signals notably angry, sad, anxious, or otherwise distracted.  
2. Occasional icebreaker breakouts  
Breakout rooms (4 people max) with question to spark conversation : "what's your favorite kitcjer applicance" "what's your guilty pleasure (sfw version)?" ...
3. Teach each other things (Lunch & learn)
4. **Give home tours (Create intimacy, help to know others, tell stories...)**
5. **Tell personal stories (private podcast)**  
Team members interview each other or talk about aspects of their background that might not be obvious. Feel closer to team mates.
6. Play silly games
7. Make the fun mandatory (team days off for fun : fun in preparing, fun in doing and fun in sharing photos and stories)
