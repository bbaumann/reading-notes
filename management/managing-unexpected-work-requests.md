## Key takeaways
Protect and be team player. Impromptu request could be used to highlight projects you have in the shelf.
Unexpected requests are opportunities (for visibility or for better roadmap). They need to be assessed.
Take time to it

### Tactic 1 : ask for priorization.
Ask what should we stop doing.
Keep it for highly disruptive requests. Can be seen as too much bureaucracy and defensiveness (no partner work)

### Tactic 2 : understand the priority
You may lack context the requester has (or vice versa).
Difference with tactic 1 is that by sharing the context you make the requester aware of the consequences.
More collaboration, roadmap adjustment

### Tactic 3 : bolster support for other unscheduled projects
The request could be used to dig up an item on your own roadmap which was de-prioritized.
Win-win situation
