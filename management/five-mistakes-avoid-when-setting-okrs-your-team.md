1. Somebody from outside the team set the OKRs
  * Unrealistic objectives set by the PO
  * no estimation
  * no owner of goals
  * **empower the people who do the actual work to set the goals for themselves**
2. Framing the key results as a to-do list
  * If the solution design change you're screwed
  * **don’t describe a particular solution; let the team innovate around the solution. An objective should be inspirational and encourage the team to be creative, innovative, and look for the easiest path to achieve it**
  * KR are not "how to"
3. Creating binary key results
  * Instead of True/False, do quantify the KR otherwise not reaching is total failure
  * ‘100% of the frontend components are migrated to the new component library’** instead **migrate to the new component
  * **The way key results are formulated matters**
4. Setting objectives that depend on each other
  * Failing the prerequisite will make the second objective unreachable
  * **objectives should be independent, and goal setting shouldn’t replace planning**
5. Setting an ambitious number of OKRs
  * Be realistic, don't overcommit
  * missing OKR has a negative morale impact but also create **distrust** in the org
  * **set ambitious goals, but also make sure that what you set is realistic.**
