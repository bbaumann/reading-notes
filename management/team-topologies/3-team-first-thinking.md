## Team First Thinking

Team is a stable group of 5 to 9 persons who work toward a shared goal as a unit.  
Families/Group/Tribes no more than 50 people (Dunbar's number)

* Use small, long-lived teams as the standard
  * Small => Max trust between members
  * Forming and Storming (Tuckman's team development model) phase takes time => long-lived team
  * Keep the team stable (!= static) and flow the work to it.
  * Usual time in a team should be between 9 to 24month depending on trust-level.
  * team owns software => involvement and think further horizons
  * team members need a team first mindset : keep discussions on track, focus on goals, help others before else, mentor, agree to explore options.
  * Diversity is important
  * Reward the team not individuals
* Good Boundaries minimize cognitive load
  * restrict team responsibilities to match cognitive load
  * "organisations should not allow a software subsystem to grow beyond the cognitive load of the team responsible for the software"
    * intrinsic cognitive load : what you fundamentaly needs to know to do a task "what is the structure of a java class?"
    * extraneous cognitive load : relates to the environment in which the task is done "how do I deploy this component again?"
    * germane cognitive load : special attention for learning or high performance "how should this service interact with the ABC service?"
  * minize intrinsic (training, hiring, pair prog), eliminate extraneous (automate), leave space for germane.
  * "if we stress the team [...] beyond its cognitive load capacity, it ceases to act like a high-perf unit and starts to behave like a loosely associated group of individuals, trying to accamplish their tasks without the space to consider if those are in the team's best interest"  
  * measure cognitive load using relative domain complexity
    * "do you feel like you're effective and able to respond in a timely fashion to the work you are asked to do?"
    * cognitive load is related to **domain complexity**
  * limit number and type of domains per team
    * assign each domain to a single team (if domain is too big, split it!)
    * one team should accomodate 2 to 3 simple domains (~routine, context switching is ok)
    * a team responsible for a complex domain should have none other (limit interruptions, no prioritization problem)
    * avoid one team responsible for two complicated domains (team will behave like two separate teams)
  * **Even if allocation of domains seem to make sense, if teams doing the work still feel overwhelmed, stress builds up and morale weakens, leading to poor results**
  *  Match software boundary size to cognitive load
  *  to increase the size of domain/software, tune ecosystem (=reduce intrinsic and extraneous loads)
  *  **Minimize cognitive load for others**
* Design team APIs and facilitate team interactions
* TODO
