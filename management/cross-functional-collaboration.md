> Humans are tribal – it’s in our DNA. Left alone, we naturally coalesce into groups that share similar beliefs and priorities and we are distrustful of those from the ‘outside’. So it is within organizations. Whether it’s by discipline or by interest, we are drawn to people who mirror our own tendencies. So when two teams, usually with different backgrounds and skill sets, come together to work towards a shared goal, naturally there is inertia and sometimes sparks fly!

1.  Build Initial Trust
  * Start from a position of objectivity and **assume good intent**
  * Beware of **narrator's bias**. Keep an open mind.
  * Build your understanding based on data and real world interations (!= rumors and reputation)
2.  Break through inertia
  * **Make the first move** (informal 1:1 often lay foundation to bring two groups together) => allow yourself to be non official ambassador
3.  Reducing anonomity
  * Be **watchful for nameless organizations** in your backlog : "we're blocked by Legal" vs "we'll have to present this to Pat"
  * builds trust, engenders empathy, and dispels fear of the unknown
4.  Coming/Working together through adversity
  * Turn bad, stressful situation into an opportunity to forge long-lasting bonds.
  * **Embrace the crisis: it makes us stronger**.
5.  Cultivating empathy
  * **See issues from another's perspective**
  * Hold your opinions loosely
6.  Celebrate
  * Send public kudos
  * Emphasize it with a private message so that **sincerity** is felt
7.  Being transparent
  * **Early and often**
  * " By sharing your blockers and why you just can’t meet another’s timeline or expectations, you enable empathy on their part and lay the groundwork for a healthy partnership long term"
8.  One team
  * share a common goal: to drive your company’s mission.
  * Together we go far
